# osticket-auto-unassign
This plugin unassigns a team or agent whenever the other is assigned, so a ticket is always either assigned to an agent or a team (not both) (based on https://forum.osticket.com/d/90581-need-to-be-able-to-unassign-team-when-reassigning-to-an-individual/8)

It has been edited on 27.10.2022 to make it compatible with osTicket v1.17 (1d8b790)
As well to have the following two options:
	- Unassigns a team or agent whenever the other is assigned, so a ticket is always either assigned to an agent or a team (not both)
	- Unassigns automatically the Agent when assigning the ticket to another Team. (A ticket can then be assigned to a Team and an Agent at the same time)
